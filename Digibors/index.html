        <p class="fotter-1">
          The financial capital of India, Mumbai is a city which never sleeps.
          Buzzing with activity, it also holds the distinction of being the
          entertainment hub of the country. With a beach in its backyard and the
          picturesque Western Ghats a stone’s throw away, the city attracts
          visitors from all over the word. From the Gateway of India which opens
          the doors to India’s mysteries, to the ancient caves of Elephanta
          Island, and from the iconic Stock Exchange to the many studios where
          Bollywood movies are made, the city offers a multitude of sights and
          experiences. The downside of life in Mumbai is the difficulty
          commuting poses. Overloaded public transport and increasing distances
          add to the stress of living in Mumbai. Whether you are a visitor to
          this melting-pot of cultures, or a resident of the city, it is
          important to have a self-drive car at your disposal to make the most
          of your time. If you do not plan to buy a car of your own, Zoomcar
          offers the perfect solution by making the process of self- drive car
          booking in Mumbai convenient and affordable. The Zoomcar app allows
          you the freedom of booking a car at your fingertips.

        <p class="fotter-1">
          On many occasions, working professionals and business persons want to
          commute to different parts of the city in the same day. Usually, they
          hire a chauffeur driven car and pay extra for the waiting charges.
          This option, while popular, is also more expensive. It is more
          economical to opt for a self-drive car rental in Mumbai. You can spend
          any amount of time at a meeting without having to worry about the
          waiting charges, and use the car to explore Mumbai after work at your
          leisure. Zoomcar also provides Mumbai airport taxi service, using
          which you can pick up one of our cars right at the airport when you
          land. We have a variety of cars in our fleet including luxury brands
          which makes it easier to book luxury cars on rent in Mumbai.

          An ideal way to relax after a stressful week at the office is to go on
          a long drive from Mumbai to Pune or from Mumbai to Nasik. Enjoy the
          drive on the wide 6-lane Mumbai – Pune expressway with your loved ones
          by taking a car on hire in Mumbai. There are many religious sites,
          parks, and museums in Nasik which makes it an ideal location to
